1) Watch the "Demo.mp4" to understand the program will work
2) Open the "Music.mp3" file to listen the song that will be played once an available appointment is found
3) Check if the "chromedriver.exe" is up-to-date. Otherwise, program will not work
4) Open the "Data.xlsx" file and fill the "Value" column with your own information
5) Install the required libraries through Terminal/Command prompt
6) Run the "Script.py". Please note that you only need to solve the reCAPTCHA manually, only once. This part is not automated, since solver services are paid services.

 After that part, you only will wait to hear the music since it will inform you that there is an available appointment in Istanbul region
